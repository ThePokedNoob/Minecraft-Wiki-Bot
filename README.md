# Minecraft-Wiki-Bot
A very, very simple Minecraft Bot that searches wikipedia for you in-game

# How to use:
After you run the script, open minecraft and type in chat !wikipedia <word>.
After just wait a bit and a short summary of that word should appear in chat.
(You can change what word triggers the word instead of !wikipedia)
  
# Additional Notes
The bot isn't 100% perfect and any changes are more than welcome. TY
